# dict full name is "dictionary" ï¼Œsome other languages will use "map"
# dict use space to change time
# dict:
# * Search and insert speed great, not related with the number of key
# * Need huge memory
# list:
# * Search and insert related with the number of key, more key more time
# * Need little memory
